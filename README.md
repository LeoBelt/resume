 Within the next year or two, I plan on transferring to the University of California, Santa Cruz where I am determined to obtain the highest CS-related degree possible. The ultimate goal of mine is to eventually earn a PHD and become a Doctor Computer Scientist, however long that may take.

### Work Experience

- **Popeyes - Vista, CA**
- *Cashier/Packer (July 2017 - Present)*
- Dealing with unhappy customers on a daily basis, and constantly packing chicken at the speed of light. This requires me to adapt to high-pressure situations and develop excellent communication skills in order to diffuse stressful situations.

### Personal Projects

- In CS111, I worked on a project that involved creating a working 3x3 Rubik's Cube program with specific commands available to the user in order to manipulate the cube in various ways. It utilized multi-dimensional arrays that changed with every move of the cube.
- In CS112, I upgraded the already-exsisting 3x3 Rubik's Cube program from CS111 and took a more user-friendly approach. I incorporated a GUI with drop down menu bars, full color integration, and added more ways to interact with the cube, such as adding the ability to randomize and immediately solve the cube.
