### Personal Projects

- In CS111, I worked on a project that involved creating a working 3x3 Rubik's Cube program with specific commands available to the user in order to manipulate the cube in various ways. It utilized multi-dimensional arrays that changed with every move of the cube.
- In CS112, I upgraded the already-exsisting 3x3 Rubik's Cube program from CS111 and took a more user-friendly approach. I incorporated a GUI with drop down menu bars, full color integration, and added more ways to interact with the cube, such as adding the ability to randomize and immediately solve the cube.
